# SQL Create Database

In SQL, the '**CREATE DATABASE**' statement is a first step for storing the structured data in the database.

The database developers and the users use this statement in SQL for creating the new database in the database systems. It creates the database with the name which has been specified in the Create Database statement.

    #### Syntax of Create Database statement in SQL

    ```SQL
    CREATE DATABASE Database_Name;  
    ```
    In this syntax, *Database_Name* specifies the name of the database which we want to create in the system. We have to type the database name in query just after the 'CREATE DATABASE' keyword.

    We created a database name *test*.

* **Step-4**: Let's delete the *test* database, that we created.

     #### Syntax of Deleteing Database statement in SQL

    ```SQL
    DROP DATABASE Database_Name;  
    ```

    In this syntax, *DROP* means *deleting* the database.
