# SQL Databases

SQL ( or Relational) databases are used to store and manage the data objects that are related to one another, i.e. *the process of handling data in a relational database is done based on a relational model*.

This relational model is an approach to manage data in a structured way (**using tables**). A system used to manage these relational databases is known as **Relational Database Management System (*RDBMS*)**.

## â–¸ SQL Database Table Structure
**SQL database server stores data in table form**. Tables are database objects used to **collect data in *Row* and *Column* format**. **Rows represent the entities** whereas **columns define the attributes of each entity in a table**.

* **Columns**: Columns are vertical elements in a table. Each column in a table holds specific attribute information, and column properties such as column name and data types (*Integer*, *Char*, *String*, etc).

* **Rows**: Rows are horizontal elements in a table and users can add data or retrieve by executing SQL queries.
